#
# Multi-stage Dockerfile for arcade-bridge. Produces a single static binary
# at /usr/local/bin/arcade-bridge on a distroless nonroot base.
#
# No ENV defaults are baked in: the bridge is configured entirely by flags, so
# pass them as the container command / Helm `args`. See docs/configuration.md.
